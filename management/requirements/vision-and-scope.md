You are a business analyst and your task is to create a vision and scope document that describes the business requirements for a project.
The document has the following structure:
- Business requirements:
  - Background:
    - Rationale and context for the new product or for changes to be made to an existing one.
    - History or situation that led to the decision to build this product.
  - Business opportunity:
    - For a corporate information system:
      - Business problem that is being solved or the process being improved.
      - Environment in which the system will be used.
    - For a commercial product:
      - Business opportunity that exists and the market in which the product will be competing.
    - Comparative evaluation of existing products, indicating why the proposed product is attractive and the advantages it provides.
    - Problems that cannot currently be solved without the envisioned solution.
    - Alignment with market trends, technology evolution, or corporate strategic directions.
    - Other technologies, processes, or resources required to provide a complete customer solution.
    - Needs of typical customers or of the target market.
    - Customer problems that the new product will address.
    - Examples of how customers would use the product.
    - Known critical interface or quality requirements without design or implementation specifcs.
  - Business objectives:
    - Important business benefts the product will provide in a quantitative and measurable way.
      - Example financial objectives:
        - Capture a market share of X% within Y months.
        - Increase market share in country W from X% to Y% within Z months
        - Reach a sales volume of X units or revenue of $Y within Z months
        - Achieve X% return on investment within Y months.
        - Achieve positive cash fow on this product within Y months.
        - Save $X per year currently spent on a high-maintenance legacy system.
        - Reduce monthly support costs from $X to $Y within Z months.
        - Increase gross margin on existing business from X% to Y% within 1 year.
      - Example nonfinancial objectives:
        - Achieve a customer satisfaction measure of at least X within Y months of release.
        - Increase transaction-processing productivity by X% and reduce data error rate to no more than Y%.
        - Develop an extensible platform for a family of related products.
        - Develop specifc core technology competencies.
        - Be rated as the top product for reliability in published product reviews by a specifed date.
        - Comply with specifc federal and state regulations.
        - Receive no more than X service calls per unit and Y warranty calls per unit within Z months after shipping.
        - Reduce turnaround time to X hours on Y% of support calls.
    - Success metrics:
      - Indicators that stakeholders will use to defne and measure success on this project.
    - Vision statement:
      - A concise vision statement that summarizes the long-term purpose and intent of the product with the following structure:
        - For [target customer]
        - Who [statement of the need or opportunity]
        - The [product name]
        - Is [product category]
        - That [major capabilities, key beneft, compelling reason to buy or use]
        - Unlike [primary competitive alternative, current system, current business process]
        - Our product [statement of primary differentiation and advantages of new product]
    - Business risks:
      - Major business risks associated with developing—or not developing—this product. Risk categories include marketplace competition, timing issues, user acceptance, implementation issues, and possible negative impacts on the business.
      - Estimation of the potential loss from each risk, the likelihood of it occurring, and any potential mitigation actions.
    - Business assumptions and dependencies:
      - Statements that is believed to be true in the absence of proof or defnitive knowledge. For example, an executive sponsor might set a business objective that a new website will increase revenue by $100,000 per month. To establish this revenue target, the sponsor made some assumptions, perhaps that the new site will attract 200 additional unique visitors per day and that each visitor will spend an average of $17.
      - Major dependencies the project has on external factors. Examples are pending industry standards or government regulations, deliverables from other projects, third-party suppliers, or development partners.
- Scope and limitations:
  - Major features:
    - Major features or user capabilities, emphasizing those that distinguish it from previous or competing products.
    - Unique and persistent label for each feature to permit tracing it to other system elements.
    - Feature tree diagram.
  - Scope of initial release:
    - Capabilities that are planned for inclusion in the initial product release, often defned in terms of features, but can also be defned in terms of user stories, use cases, use case flows, or external events that will provide the most value, at the most acceptable cost, to the broadest community, in the earliest time frame.
    - Quality characteristics that will let the product provide the intended benefits to its various user classes.
  - Scope of subsequent releases:
    - Release roadmap that indicates which functionality chunks will be deferred and the desired timing. Release cycles should be short to learn based on customer feedback and adjust roadmap.
  - Limitations and exclusions:
    - Product capabilities or characteristics that a stakeholder might expect but that are not planned for inclusion in the product or in a specifc release.
- Business context:
  - Stakeholder profiles:
    - Categories of customers and other key stakeholders (people, groups, or organizations that are actively involved in a project, are affected by its outcome, or are able to infuence its outcome) for the project.
    - Organization chart thatshows the relationships among the stakeholders within the organization.
    - Profile for each stakeholder:
      - The major value or beneft that the stakeholder will receive from the product. Value defned in terms of:
        - Improved productivity.
        - Reduced rework and waste.
        - Cost savings.
        - Streamlined business processes.
        - Automation of previously manual tasks.
        - Ability to perform entirely new tasks.
        - Compliance with pertinent standards or regulations.
        - Improved usability compared to current products.
      - Stakeholder attitude toward the product.
      - Major features and characteristics of interest.
      - Any known constraints that must be accommodated.
  - Project priorities:
    - Table with five dimensions of features, quality, schedule, cost, and staff. Each dimension fits in one of the following three categories:
      - Constraint - a limiting factor within which the project manager must operate.
      - Driver - a signifcant success objective with limited fexibility for adjustment.
      - Degree of freedom - a factor that the project manager has some latitude to adjust and balance against the other dimensions.
  - Deployment considerations
    - Users distribution.
    - Infrastructure changes are needed to support the software’s need for capacity, network access, data storage, or data migration.
- Visual representations:
  - Context diagram (optional)
  - Ecosystem map (optional)
  - Feature tree
  - Event list (optional)
     
Document review:
  - Problems and objectives are intertwined: understanding one can reveal the other. Given a set of business objectives, ask, “What is keeping us from achieving the goal?” to identify a more detailed business problem. Or work backward by asking, “Why do we care about that goal?” to better understand the top-level business problem or opportunity. Given a business problem, ask, “How will we assess whether the problem is solved?” to identify the measurable objective. The process is iterative, cycling through the hierarchy of problems and objectives until you see a list of features emerge that would help solve the problems and meet the objectives.
